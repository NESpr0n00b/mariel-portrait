    "name": "Nayeon",
    "text": "Charles  Bukowski  was  an  alcoholic,  a  womanizer,  a  chronic  gambler,  a  lout,  a  cheapskate,  a
deadbeat, and on his worst days, a poet. He’s probably the last person on earth you would ever look to
for life advice or expect to see in any sort of self-help book.
Which is why he’s the perfect place to start.
Bukowski wanted to be a writer. But for decades his work was rejected by almost every magazine,
newspaper,  journal,  agent,  and  publisher  he  submitted  to.  His  work  was  horrible,  they  said.  Crude.
Disgusting. Depraved. And as the stacks of rejection slips piled up, the weight of his failures pushed
him deep into an alcohol-fueled depression that would follow him for most of his life.
Bukowski had a day job as a letter-filer at a post office. He got paid shit money and spent most of
it on booze. He gambled away the rest at the racetrack. At night, he would drink alone and sometimes
hammer out poetry on his beat-up old typewriter. Often, he’d wake up on the floor, having passed out
the night before.
Thirty  years  went  by  like  this,  most  of  it  a  meaningless  blur  of  alcohol,  drugs,  gambling,  and
prostitutes. Then, when Bukowski was fifty, after a lifetime of failure and self-loathing, an editor at a
small  independent  publishing  house  took  a  strange  interest  in  him.  The  editor  couldn’t  offer
Bukowski much money or much promise of sales. But he had a weird affection for the drunk loser, so
he  decided  to  take  a  chance  on  him.  It  was  the  first  real  shot  Bukowski  had  ever  gotten,  and,  he
realized, probably the only one he would ever get. Bukowski wrote back to the editor: “I have one of
two choices—stay in the post office and go crazy . . . or stay out here and play at writer and starve. I
have decided to starve.”
Upon  signing  the  contract,  Bukowski  wrote  his  first  novel  in  three  weeks.  It  was  called  simply
Post Office. In the dedication, he wrote, “Dedicated to nobody.”
Bukowski  would  make  it  as  a  novelist  and  poet.  He  would  go  on  and  publish  six  novels  and
hundreds of poems, selling over two million copies of his books. His popularity defied everyone’s
expectations, particularly his own.
Stories  like  Bukowski’s  are  the  bread  and  butter  of  our  cultural  narrative.  Bukowski’s  life
embodies  the  American  Dream:  a  man  fights  for  what  he  wants,  never  gives  up,  and  eventually
achieves  his  wildest  dreams.  It’s  practically  a  movie  waiting  to  happen.  We  all  look  at  stories  like
Bukowski’s and say, “See? He never gave up. He never stopped trying. He always believed in himself.
He persisted against all the odds and made something of himself!”
It is then strange that on Bukowski’s tombstone, the epitaph reads: “Don’t try.”
See,  despite  the  book  sales  and  the  fame,  Bukowski  was  a  loser.  He  knew  it.  And  his  success
stemmed not from some determination to be a winner, but from the fact that he knew he was a loser,
accepted it, and then wrote honestly about it. He never tried to be anything other than what he was. The
genius in Bukowski’s work was not in overcoming unbelievable odds or developing himself into a
shining  literary  light.  It  was  the  opposite.  It  was  his  simple  ability  to  be  completely,  unflinchingly
honest  with  himself—especially  the  worst  parts  of  himself—and  to  share  his  failings  without
hesitation or doubt.
This  is  the  real  story  of  Bukowski’s  success:  his  comfort  with  himself  as  a  failure.  Bukowski
didn’t give a fuck about success. Even after his fame, he still showed up to poetry readings hammered
and verbally abused people in his audience. He still exposed himself in public and tried to sleep with
every  woman  he  could  find.  Fame  and  success  didn’t  make  him  a  better  person.  Nor  was  it  by
becoming a better person that he became famous and successful.
Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the
same thing.
Our culture today is obsessively focused on unrealistically positive expectations: Be happier. Be
healthier.  Be  the  best,  better  than  the  rest.  Be  smarter,  faster,  richer,  sexier,  more  popular,  more
productive, more envied, and more admired. Be perfect and amazing and crap out twelve-karat-gold
nuggets  before  breakfast  each  morning  while  kissing  your  selfie-ready  spouse  and  two  and  a  half
kids  goodbye.  Then  fly  your  helicopter  to  your  wonderfully  fulfilling  job,  where  you  spend  your
days doing incredibly meaningful work that’s likely to save the planet one day.
But when you stop and really think about it, conventional life advice—all the positive and happy
self-help  stuff  we  hear  all  the  time—is  actually  fixating  on  what  you  lack.  It  lasers  in  on  what  you
perceive  your  personal  shortcomings  and  failures  to  already  be,  and  then  emphasizes  them  for  you.
You  learn  about  the  best  ways  to  make  money  because  you  feel  you  don’t  have  enough  money
already. You stand in front of the mirror and repeat affirmations saying that you’re beautiful because
you  feel  as  though  you’re  not  beautiful  already.  You  follow  dating  and  relationship  advice  because
you  feel  that  you’re  unlovable  already.  You  try  goofy  visualization  exercises  about  being  more
successful because you feel as though you aren’t successful enough already.
Ironically, this fixation on the positive—on what’s better, what’s superior—only serves to remind
us over and over again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to
be. After all, no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she’s
happy. She just is.
There’s a saying in Texas: “The smallest dog barks the loudest.” A confident man doesn’t feel a
need to prove that he’s confident. A rich woman doesn’t feel a need to convince anybody  that  she’s
rich.  Either you are  or  you  are  not.  And  if  you’re  dreaming  of  something  all  the  time,  then  you’re
reinforcing the same unconscious reality over and over: that you are not that.
Everyone and their TV commercial wants you to believe that the key to a good life is a nicer job,
or a more rugged car, or a prettier girlfriend, or a hot tub with an inflatable pool for the kids. The
world  is  constantly  telling  you  that  the  path  to  a  better  life  is  more,  more,  more—buy  more,  own
more, make more, fuck more, be more. You are constantly bombarded with messages to give a fuck
about everything, all the time. Give a fuck about a new TV. Give a fuck about having a better vacation
than your coworkers. Give a fuck about buying that new lawn ornament. Give a fuck about having the
right kind of selfie stick.
Why? My guess: because giving a fuck about more stuff is good for business.
And while there’s nothing wrong with good business, the problem is that giving too many fucks is
bad  for  your  mental  health.  It  causes  you  to  become  overly  attached  to  the  superficial  and  fake,  to
dedicate  your  life  to  chasing  a  mirage  of  happiness  and  satisfaction.  The  key  to  a  good  life  is  not
giving  a  fuck  about  more;  it’s  giving  a  fuck  about  less,  giving  a  fuck  about  only  what  is  true  and
immediate and important.
